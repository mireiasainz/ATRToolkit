This folder contains the code used to perform the calibration procedure and determination of the permittivity presented in "Permittivity determination of inorganic nanoparticles by ATR spectroscopy: comparison with reflectance techniques and limitations." by Sainz-Mench√≥n et al.

The following files can be found:

"polarization_fraction.ipynb" : Jupyther notebook for determining the polarization fraction induced by the spectrometer and ATR equipment.

"permittivity_determination.ipynb" : Jupyther notebook for determining the permittivity of inorganic nanoparticles. The code is exemplified using the delta-Al2O3 sample data presented in the paper.

"module.py": python file containing all the functions used in both Jupyther Notebook codes.

"ATR_absorbance_H2O.dat" : experimental ATR absorbance data for distilled H2O

"ATR_absorbance_delta_Al2O3_NPs.dat" : experimental ATR absorbance data for delta-al2o3

"ATR_absorbance_gamma_Al2O3_NPs.dat" : experimental ATR absorbance data for gamma-al2o3
